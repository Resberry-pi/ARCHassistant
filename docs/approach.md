# Approach to Solve the Problem

Arch Assistant is designed to unify multiple AI models, APIs, and services into a single voice-controlled assistant.  
Our unique approach lies in:
- **Modular integration**: Different APIs (Sarvam, Gemini, DeepSeek, etc.) combined seamlessly.
- **Human-like interaction**: Uses speech recognition + TTS for natural conversations.
- **Scalable design**: Easy to add new models or services without breaking existing flow.
- **Hardware + Software synergy**: Works with STM32, ESP32, and PCs for embedded + cloud AI.
